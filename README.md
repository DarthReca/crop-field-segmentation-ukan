**This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks**. Our findings indicate a 2% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in **fewer GFLOPs**. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to **focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas** rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.

*REPOSITORY IN CONSTRUCTION SOME FILES COULD BE MISSING*

### Getting Started

Install the dependencies of the *requirements.txt* file. Make sure to edit the config files in the `configs/` folder. Then, simply run *main.py* to train the models.
Use the *xai.ipynb* for the explainability part.
